# BuberBreakfastApi
.Net6 REST API for breakfasts using Swagger, AutoMapper and ErrorOr with study purposes

This API was developed following this video reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmDJIooZjBE, but I prefered to add Swagger and AutoMapper
as a better way of dealing with the API specification and documentation, and a better way of dealing with object mapping. ErrorOr is used as a better way of dealing with exceptions and error handling

still in progress...
